# Mahabali
(since during kerala floods, people were not able to celebrate [Onam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam) in which it is believed that [Mahabali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam#Mahabali_legend) comes from heaven and thus the name of our project is Mahabali)

### Objective
Our main focus while ideation has been [Kerala Floods 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods).
We plan to develop Jarvis which does all work from A-Z in such situations.\
The system will be able to:

1. Send Unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) to:
	- **Find** people who may be stranded in floods (and not easily visible from ground) and,
	- **Identify missing people**.
2. Help them **navigate** to safe locations
	- Determine an **optimal path** to take
	- **Accompany them** till they reach the destination.
	- Notify nearest rescue teams for on ground support.

### Challenges faced during Kerala Floods and how Mahabali overcomes them
1. Locating groups
> UAVs will find groups of people (using thermal imagining) that might not be visible from ground and reach out to them to help them.

2. Missing people
> Drones will recognize faces of people during disaster and match them with the database of our PersonFinder portal database and will return the location of that user to the nearest rescue team.

3. It took a lot of manual time to find the safe path to rescue
> Drones will return the location to our server which will use a **situation-aware** algorithm and find the most optimal path to travel from that location to the nearest safe zone.
