(since during kerala floods, people were not able to celebrate [Onam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam) in which it is believed that [Mahabali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam#Mahabali_legend) comes from heaven and thus the name of our project is Mahabali)

###### Challenge for Microsoft's codefundo++ challenge to predict or manage natural disasters.
Our main focus while ideation has been [Kerala Floods 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods).
We plan to develop Jarvis which does all work from A-Z in such situations.\
The system will be able to:

..* **Identify** the faces of all people and match them with the database of **missing people** and return their location to our server.
..2. Help them **navigate** to safe locations by situation aware algorithm(s) that suggests **optinmal path** to travel through and will **accompany them** until and unless they reach the nearest safe place. (safe places would be marked by us in the city or outside the city)
..3. Server finds a situation-aware algorithms considering the real time weather updates and on ground conditions and return that path to the drone
..4.
