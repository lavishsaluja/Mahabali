# Mahabali
(since during kerala floods, people were not able to celebrate [Onam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam) in which it is believed that [Mahabali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam#Mahabali_legend) comes from heaven and thus the name of our project is Mahabali)

### Challenge for Microsoft's codefundo++ to predict or manage natural disasters.
Our main focus while ideation has been [Kerala Floods 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods).
We plan to develop Jarvis which does all work from A-Z in such situations.\
The system will be able to:

1. Send Unmanned aerial vehicles to:
	- **Find** people who may be stranded in floods (and not easily visible from ground) and,
	- **Identify missing people**.
2. Help them **navigate** to safe locations
	- Determine an **optimal path** to take
	- **Accompany them** till they reach the destination.
	- Notify nearest rescue teams for on ground support.
